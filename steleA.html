    <h2>1. Cleo</h2>
    <p>
      Cleo, who was pregnant for five years, came as a suppliant to the god and slept in the abaton.
      As soon as she left the temple precinct, she gave birth to a boy who, immediately, washed himself at the fountain and walked around with his mother.

    <h2>2. Ithmonika</h2>
    <p>
      Ithmonika of Pellene, pregnant for three years, came to the sanctuary to conceive a child.
      She slept there and had a dream: she believed she had asked the god for a daughter, and Asklepios replied that would indeed be the case.
      He also told her that if she wished for anything else, he would grant it too. She asked nothing further.
      She conceived and carried the child for three years until she returned here as a suppliant for the birth.
      Again sleeping in the abaton, she saw a vision: the god asked whether her request had been fulfilled and whether she was pregnant.
      She had asked nothing about childbirth, so he told her to speak up if she needed anything, and he would take care of it.
      As she had come explicitly for childbirth, he assured her he would handle it.
      Immediately, she left the abaton and, as soon as she was outside, gave birth to a daughter.

    <h2>3. Euhippos</h2>
    <p>
      Euhippos, a man from Aegion who was mute from birth, came to the god.
      After performing the customary sacrifices and rites, he slept in the temple and had a dream.
      He dreamed that the god approached him and touched his tongue with a healing herb.
      When day came, he walked out of the temple speaking clearly, and recounted to everyone what he had seen in the dream.

  <div class="miracle">
    <h2>4. Hermodikos</h2>
    <p>
      Hermodikos of Lampsacus, suffering from paralysis, came as a supplicant to the god.
      While sleeping in the temple, he had a dream: he dreamed the god opened his head and removed the disease.
      When morning came, he walked out healed.
